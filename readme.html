WordPress E-commerce Website

This is a WordPress e-commerce website that you can run locally on your PC using MAMP and manage the code using GitHub.

Installation

Prerequisites

- Make sure you have MAMP (or any other local server environment like XAMPP) installed on your PC.
- You need to have WordPress installed in your MAMP server. If you haven't installed it, you can download it from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/) and follow the installation instructions provided there.

Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/sergeytomko/dyplom_2024
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: cd your-repo
3. Copy the contents of the repository to your MAMP's WordPress directory (usually located at `MAMP/htdocs/`).

4. Start your MAMP server and make sure both Apache and MySQL servers are running.

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`. Create a new database for your WordPress installation.

6. Rename the `wp-config-sample.php` file to `wp-config.php` and update the database details (database name, username, password) in this file to match the database you created in step 5.

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-repo/`. Follow the WordPress installation wizard, providing the necessary information when prompted.

Usage

Once installed, you can access and manage your WordPress e-commerce website by visiting `http://localhost/your-repo/` in your web browser. You can log in to the WordPress admin panel using the credentials you set during the installation.
